# Deprecated

Some of the functionalities were partially implemented or not used after switching such that the may not work anymore.

**The following features have not been tested and their use was stopped independent thereof:**
* Simulation setup in LAMMPS, including generation of Slurm input files, some paths are hard coded as of now.
* Bond and dihedral angle potentials for Calvados simulations.
* Bond and dihedral angle analysis.
These features might still work.

**The following features are known not to work:**
* Polyply setup for Calvados3: Elastic Network Models are not properly generated with polyply.
